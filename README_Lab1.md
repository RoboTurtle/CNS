The repository represents a way to distrubute and share work with peers and teachers.  It allows others to check up on progress and look at submissions.  I chose to install vscode for my editor as it allows me to access it without having to switch between windows.  It is also integrated closely with Git and makes edits easier to manage.  It also provide an easy to use interface that is pleasant to look at.
