This homework was designed to teach us how to attach a specific docker that we found interesting

## Interesting containers
#### mySQL
The first interesting docker I looked at was mySQL which is one of the most widely used open source database management systems.
The organization behind the container is mySQL/Oracle.  There are a number of associated options such as database initialization, 
character set and collation, port mapping, and more.  What makes the mySQL docker unique is the how configurable it is. MySQL 
containers are highly configurable through environment variables, making it possible to set up databases, users, and passwords 
during container initialization. This level of configuration is unique to database containers and differs from stateless application containers.

#### Python
Next I looked at python considering I am currently taking CML and the class involves coding in python so I was curious.  It builds an environment
ideal to code in python.  The organization behind the container is the Python Software Foundation.  When it comes to associated options, python has
the option for choosing the python base image, installing dependencies, setting environemnt variables, among other options.  WHat makes it unique is
that it specifically sets up an environment ideal for python usage, including things such as package managemnt, version control, and python frameworks.
