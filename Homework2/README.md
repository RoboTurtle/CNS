This homework was designed to teach us how to attach a specific docker that we found interesting

## Interesting containers
#### mySQL
The first interesting docker I looked at was mySQL which is one of the most widely used open source database management systems.
The organization behind the container is mySQL/Oracle.  There are a number of associated options such as database initialization, 
character set and collation, port mapping, and more.  What makes the mySQL docker unique is the how configurable it is. MySQL 
containers are highly configurable through environment variables, making it possible to set up databases, users, and passwords 
during container initialization. This level of configuration is unique to database containers and differs from stateless application containers.
