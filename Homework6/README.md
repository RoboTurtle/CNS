## Splunk training: Intro to Splunk
I took the Intro to Splunk course.  This course began with some initial basics.  It went over what Splunk is and what it covered as well as different roles associated with Splunk (User, power, and admin)  It also went over data ingestion, where the data that it took in came from.  It went over how to do proper searches and querying and how to sort the language in order to perform the searches.  It taught how to set up visualizations and your dashboard in order to present data in an attractive and digestible fashion.  It showed how to set up alerting and reporting in order to generate reports and share data findings.  The course also went over knowledge objects.  The five main knowledge objects the course went over were Saved searches, customs searches saved for future use, reports, which are used to format and present results of saved searches, dashboard, while allow compiling visualizations into a single view.  Field extractions, which allow you to define custom field in the data, making searching for data easier, and lookups, which are tables or files that allow someone to enrich data with additional information.
